# Movie Rating Prediction System

This project aims to predict the rating of a movie based on various factors such as genre, cast, director, and other related features using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the rating of a movie based on available data. This can be useful for movie recommendation systems, helping users discover movies that match their preferences.

## Steps Followed

### ◼ Data Collection
Gathered a dataset containing information about movies, such as movie title, genre, cast, director, release year, budget, and historical ratings.

### ◼ Data Preparation
Cleaned and pre-processed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical values.

### ◼ Feature Engineering
Created additional features such as the number of votes, movie length, or budget-to-revenue ratio to improve the predictive model.

### ◼ Data Visualization
Used data visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to understand the relationship between various features and the target variable (movie rating).

### ◼ Model Selection
Chosen a suitable machine learning algorithm for the task. In this case, models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest were explored for rating prediction.

### ◼ Data Splitting
The dataset was split into training and testing sets to ensure that the model can be trained and evaluated on separate data.

### ◼ Model Training
Trained the selected machine learning model(s) on the training dataset.

### ◼ Model Evaluation
Assessed the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## Outcome

The system is able to predict the ratings of movies based on various input features. The accuracy of the model can be further improved with more advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning or more complex algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
